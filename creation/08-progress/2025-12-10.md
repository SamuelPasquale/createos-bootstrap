# Progress Log — 2025-12-10

## Summary of Work Completed
- Replaced the dual-chat V0 bootstrapping guidance with a CreateOS-native session startup protocol (Session Manager + consent + persistent memory).
- Authored an MVP blueprint for the Session Manager, consent UX, persistent memory API, and single-click resume flow.
- Updated README to foreground the native startup flow and authoritative docs.
- Added tasks for Session Manager prototyping, memory API implementation, and resume UX tests.

## Current System State
- Session start protocol now targets signed per-session tokens, repo metadata mounting, and audit traces.
- Session Manager blueprint defines flows, memory API endpoints, tests, and risks.
- Task graph includes native startup follow-on work; memory log captures the design decision.

## Open Items / TODOs
- Prototype Session Manager service with consent-integrated connector issuance (T005).
- Implement persistent memory API with versioning and manual compaction (T006).
- Build resume UX plus end-to-end bootstrap and revocation tests (T007).
- Decide storage and key management approach for audit logs and signing keys.

## Next Session Starting Point
1. Stand up Session Manager skeleton (token issuance, metadata endpoint, audit log stub).
2. Implement append-only memory API and compaction path; define checksum format.
3. Design Consent UI screens and revocation flow aligned with least-privilege scopes.
4. Wire bootstrap trace emission from Architect/Codex actions and validate audit coverage.
