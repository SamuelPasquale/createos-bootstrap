TODO — December 11 Work Session (Authoritative List)

1. Fix session-start protocol to accurately reflect V0

Rewrite creation/06-decisions/session-start-protocol.md so that it:

Correctly describes the actual V0 dual-chat workflow (Architect chat outside project → attach GitHub connector → move chat into project).

Removes or archives any inaccurate references to future V1 / Session Manager flows.

Aligns with README and architecture documents.


Outcome: Session-start-protocol.md becomes a reliable guide for booting V0 sessions.


---

2. Generate & commit final V0 architecture document

Update the architecture document to fully match:

The real V0 runtime,

The dual-chat boot,

The tools/close_session.py save/close model,

The repository-as-memory architecture.


Ensure no references to V1-native boot are present in the V0 doc.

Commit to creation/04-artifacts/createos-architecture-v0.md.


Outcome: A complete, final, correct V0 architectural description.


---

3. Implement V0 improvements

3.1 Fix README to ensure full consistency

Update README so:

Canonical V0 workflow is preserved and correct,

No V1-native flow replaces current V0,

Cross-references between README and session-start-protocol are aligned.


3.2 Confirm init workflow is correct

Test the full V0 initialization pathway manually.

Validate:

Dual-chat boot,

Repo access,

Index load,

Memory load,

Ability to hand instructions to Codex.



3.3 Ensure project files are consolidated into repo

Move remaining ChatGPT Project files into the repo:

Work logs,

Architectural notes,

Planning notes,

Any documents used during development.


Once moved, prune the ChatGPT Project files down to only lightweight reference items.


3.4 Smooth out session close/save workflows

Validate that tools/close_session.py:

Writes progress logs correctly,

Updates LATEST.json,

Appends to memory.md,

Correctly marks completed tasks.


Ensure documentation for /close or manual close instructions is crystal clear.


3.5 Store system prompts in repo (lowest priority)

Formalize system prompts:

Architect prompt,

Developer (Codex) prompt,

Any environment-specific operational prompt.


Store them under:
creation/04-artifacts/agent-prompts/

4. Add missing V0 tasks that surfaced today

These are still part of V0 and must be done before we consider V0 “fully stable.”

4.1 Define canonical file-placement conventions

We need to formally codify:

What belongs in /01-goals

What belongs in /02-roadmap

What belongs in /03-v0

What belongs in /04-artifacts

What belongs in /05-memory

What belongs in /06-decisions

What belongs in /07-tasks

What belongs in /08-progress


This becomes a decision doc once agreed.

4.2 Validate repository indexing & structure

Ensure .createos/index.json remains correct,

Ensure new documents (architecture, protocol) are included and indexed after commit.



---

5. Begin planning V0.5 (Copilot-based runtime) — exploratory, not implementation

Not part of tomorrow’s main work block, but we will schedule it once V0 is complete.

Tomorrow just requires:

A short architectural scoping discussion summarizing:

What V0.5 should achieve,

How GitHub Copilot Spaces + Agents replace the ChatGPT/Codex split,

How both runtimes can coexist in the same repo without conflict,

What a migration path looks like.



No implementation tomorrow — just scoping and documentation.

Summary: Your December 11 Work Plan

1. Fix Session-Start Protocol (V0 accurate).


2. Finalize & commit V0 Architecture Document.


3. Repair README and unify all V0 docs.


4. Consolidate project files into repo.


5. Validate session close/save system.


6. Add system prompts (low priority).


7. Define canonical file-placement rules.


8. Verify index + repo structure.


9. OPTIONAL: Scope V0.5 (Copilot runtime).
