# CreateOS Bootstrap — December 12, 2025 — Session Log

## Summary

Transitioned repository documentation and task tracking to reflect V0.5 Copilot runtime as the primary operational mode, with V0 (dual-chat + Git-backed tools) retained as a maintenance/fallback runtime. This shift acknowledges the successful implementation of V0.5 agent prompts, GitHub Action-based session bootstrap, and Copilot Space/Agent architecture.

Key changes:
- Formally designated V0.5 as the primary runtime in README and documentation
- Updated task graph to mark V0 implementation tasks (T002, T003) as maintenance-only
- Clarified that T005 (Session Manager service) is superseded by V0.5 patterns
- Added new tasks for V0.5 smoke PR flow (T010) and README runtime documentation (T011)
- Created canonical file-placement conventions decision document
- Created V0.5 runtime scope artifact documenting roles, objectives, and acceptance criteria

## Completed Tasks

- **T004** — Design CreateOS-native session startup (Session Manager, consent, persistent memory, audit trace)
  - *Status*: Complete (design artifacts exist; service implementation superseded by V0.5)
  
- **T008** — Define and document canonical file-location conventions
  - *Status*: Complete (decision document created: `creation/06-decisions/file-placement-conventions.md`)
  
- **T009** — Design and implement V0.5 runtime using GitHub Copilot
  - *Status*: Complete (agent prompts, GitHub Action, session bootstrap implemented)
  
- **T011** — Update README with Runtime Mode section
  - *Status*: Complete (README now documents V0.5 primary, V0 fallback)

## Next Steps

1. **Execute V0.5 smoke PR** (T010)
   - Run full session bootstrap flow using GitHub Action
   - Validate session_id tagging in commits and PR metadata
   - Verify readiness banner parity
   - Confirm CI index refresh includes new artifacts

2. **Optional V0 fallback documentation**
   - Create minimal runbook under `creation/03-v0/` for V0 dual-chat fallback
   - Document troubleshooting and emergency fallback procedures

3. **Finalize session_id tagging strategy**
   - Define conventions for commit messages and PR descriptions
   - Update close_session.py if needed to emit session_id metadata

4. **V0.5 operational refinements**
   - Test Architect → Developer handoff with real PR
   - Validate boot JSON schema and acceptance criteria
   - Refine agent prompts based on operational experience
