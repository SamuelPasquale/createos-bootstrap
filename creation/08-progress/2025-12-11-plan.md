2025-12-11 — Work Plan (V0 Completion Sequence)

This document captures the planned work sequence for December 11, 2025, focused on finalizing the CreateOS V0 architecture and workflows. It reflects all architectural decisions, discussions, and alignments made at the end of the 2025-12-10 session.


---

Objectives for Today

The goal of this work block is to:

1. Fully align documentation (README + session-start protocol) with actual V0 behavior.


2. Commit the final V0 architecture document.


3. Execute the final set of improvements needed to solidify V0 as a stable, deterministic workflow.



This plan defines the canonical sequence to follow.


---

1. Fix session-start protocol to accurately reflect V0

Purpose

Ensure that creation/06-decisions/session-start-protocol.md describes the actual, working V0 boot sequence rather than the forward-looking V1/Session Manager flow.

Actions

Restore the canonical V0 dual-chat bootstrap as the authoritative “Current Behavior.”

Move all Session Manager content to a clearly labeled:
“Planned / Design only — not implemented” section.

Add a header notice indicating:
“This file documents the current V0 protocol. V1 protocol is forthcoming and included purely for design reference.”

Validate alignment with README wording.



---

2. Generate & commit final V0 architecture document

Purpose

Capture the complete architecture of V0, including:

What V0 is and is not.

How CreateOS operates today (Architect + Codex + GitHub).

Full explanation of workflows: bootstrap, work loop, save/close.

Clear description of what features defer to V1 (Session Manager, Save/Resume, unified agents, etc.)


Actions

Architect will author the document in-chat.

Save to:
creation/04-artifacts/c01-architecture-v0-v1.md

Link from README.



---

3. Implement V0 improvements

3.1 Fix README, ensure consistency

Purpose

README must unambiguously represent V0 as the working system.

Actions

Ensure V0 workflow is preserved exactly.

Keep the “Planned CreateOS-Native Session Startup” section as design only.

Ensure no future behavior is implied as implemented.



---

3.2 Confirm init workflow is correct

Purpose

Verify that the documented boot procedure works exactly as expected when starting a new session.

Actions

Validate integration steps (repo attachment → SHA → “Load the repo”).

Validate fallback paths for .createos/index.json.

Make corrections if any ambiguity is found.



---

3.3 Ensure project files are consolidated into repo

Purpose

Nothing important should live solely in the ChatGPT Project files.

Actions

Move any attached documents, specs, notes, or thesis files into appropriate directories in the repo.

Refresh .createos/index.json afterward.



---

3.4 Smooth out session close/save workflows

Purpose

Finalize tools/close_session.py as a stable V0 “Save & Close” equivalent.

Actions

Ensure memory append works (import + CLI fallback both functional).

Ensure tasks update correctly.

Ensure progress markdown file + LATEST.json both generate correctly.

Add README documentation on how to run it.



---

3.5 Store system prompts in repo (lowest priority)

Purpose

Preserve canonical system prompts for future CreateOS components.

Actions

Add Architect + Developer system prompts to:
creation/04-artifacts/agent-prompts/

Treat as low-priority but part of V0 readiness.



---

Work Pattern for Today

1. Begin new Architect chat using V0 bootstrap instructions.


2. Execute tasks sequentially:
1 → 2 → 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4 → 3.5


3. For each step, the Architect will generate a Codex instruction package for the Developer agent.


4. Review and merge PRs as needed.


5. End the session using tools/close_session.py.
